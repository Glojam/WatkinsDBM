  - **Admin** - Grants search and edit permissions
  - **Guest** - Read-only; only search permissions

## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> WatkinsDBM does not have a code signing certificate due to budget limitations.
> On Windows and Mac machines, this means your antivirus may flag the program as malicious. You should still be able to run the program regardless.
> 
> If you have concerns about this, talk to your database host or IT administrator.

To install Watkins Database Manager, navigate to the Releases panel on this page and download the latest version for your respective platform (Windows/Mac/Linux).

## Notes
WatkinsDBM is not generalizable for any arbitrary MSSQL database and requires a tailored instance.
